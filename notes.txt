12/8:
1. Created app ;)
2. Created controller
	=> made a test page

12/9
1. Pushed to heroku
	=> PROBLEMS!!!
	A. Sqlite needed to go from ative side to "group:development, :test"
	
	B. config/application.rb 
	=> added config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false to the end
	per https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails-asset-pipeline#troubleshooting

	While precompiling assets, in Rails 3.x, you can prevent initializing your application and connecting to the database by ensuring that the following line is in your config/application.rb

	C. Next error was that I got a "connection refused"
	=> per same above link
	... forgot to git add, commit, etc ;)

2. A "Duhh" moment

I was running some rspec tests and was trying to figure out why it was not working. Essentially, in my test file I had it looking at "users/index" and then I got an error asking for a show page method, and when I went ahead and made one in the controller it then asked me to create a show template.

My routes read as follows:

    users GET    /users(.:format)          users#index
          POST   /users(.:format)          users#create
 new_user GET    /users/new(.:format)      users#new
edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format) users#edit
     user GET    /users/:id(.:format)      users#show
          PUT    /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
          DELETE /users/:id(.:format)      users#destroy

Ok... lets test what happens if I update the routes to have :

get "users/index"

users_index GET    /users/index(.:format)    users#index

OK, now my test works ... AHHA!

Before when I had my rspec test look at users/index my "resources :users" default didn't have that! 

My TEST was wrong. By having it go to "/users" I got the test to pass... YAY!

3. About Me page

Well, I was about to make an about me page and throw that into the show for users or just force the route via a get users/about. Nether felt right.

Rather, I have decided to make a new "site" controller and put it there... where it should be!!

4. Why is the title for a rails app not showing up the way I expected?

If you look into your views/layouts/application.html.erb this may override whatever else you may have. Still trying to figure out how to OVERRIDE that ;)
